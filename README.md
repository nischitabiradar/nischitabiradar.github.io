**DATASET**

I chose the San Fransisco Government Open Data website since it was actually created by the City Government of San Fransisco. Launched more than 14 years ago, it contains various data on the City’s economy, infrastructure, housing, and public safety. I think it is a great initiative to encourage transparency, while also encouraging the public to analyze and understand various statistics pertaining to the city.
Each dataset that is uploaded contains the date of upload and last modification date, and various other metadata like a brief description of the study, explanations for each column heading, and the data collection process. Each study is tagged under various categories and departments for improved searchability. The methodology for the surveys/ data collection is disclosed, along with the potential limitations for each dataset.

One dataset I was particularly interested in was the Incident Report Dataset, maintained and updated every single day by the Police Department of San Fransisco. It has been updated every day since January 1, 2018. There is also a historical dataset containing data from 2003 until 2018. The dataset contains data related to each incident- incident date, incident type (assault, theft, fraud, etc), incident district and exact address, the status of the incident (active, inactive).

The dataset is quite comprehensive, and I can think of several ways this can be applied:

+ Trend analysis: Not only can we monitor crime trends over the length of this dataset, i.e. 2018 to the present day, but we can also summarize and compare it to the historical dataset to
  observe if any patterns are on the rise. For example: just from a quick scroll of both the datasets, it seems that car-related crimes are on the rise in SF, although this will need 
  actual analysis to be verified.
+ Predictive modeling: We can utilize machine learning models to help us predict future incidents, which may be a tool to help policymakers and government officials be more prepared 
  for future incidents.
+ Journalism: Over the last couple of decades, we have seen journalism as a whole trend toward opinion pieces as opposed to fact-based reporting. Research has shown that if certain 
  crimes are extensively covered by news agencies in a manner that does not reflect reality, it tends to warp public perceptions of those crimes and may lead us to believe that it is 
  more pervasive than what the real-world data show us. Considering the data we have available at hand here, we can hope that this may encourage a few journalists to adopt a more data- 
  driven approach to help improve their reporting and provide context which may help the public have a better understanding of what is going on.
+ Feedback to policymakers: Policymakers can monitor the latest trends to help understand if any policies enacted in the past have had an impact on the current situation. For example, 
  if a law was passed in 2020 increasing the minimum sentencing for drug possession, we can monitor incidents related to that category for each subsequent year- 2021, 2022, 2023 or 
  even incorporate machine learning to obtain forecasts for 2024 and 2025 based on the current trends. This should help provide them with an understanding of the ramifications of their
  policies.

*The Quest for Artificial Intelligence- A History of Ideas and Achievements*

Link to the Book: [The Quest for Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.stanford.edu/~nilsson/QAI/qai.pdf)

Author: Nils J. Nilsson

Organization: Stanford University

This book aims to present the history of human thought, ideas, and understanding of Artificial Intelligence in the fields of life, neuroscience, psychology, cognitive science, evolution, bionics, engineering, and so on. It also delves into key events and advancements in the 1950s and 1960s, such as the Dartmouth Summer Project, learning machines, mechanization of thought processes, and pattern recognition technologies like character recognition and neural networks. I am interested in this book because of late, the hot topic is AI and the implications it has on human jobs, culture, and society. Furthermore, as someone hoping to enter the field of analytics, which is going to be heavily impacted by AI, it would be useful to learn from someone with a well-researched perspective on the subject, complete with its entire history and the ideas of early pioneers in the field.
